A daily cron job (ID: 50258180-e1ef-4b13-bdd4-fd941cce93a4, name: cortex-daily-backup) runs at 3:00 AM CT to backup cortex.db to /Users/cole/.openclaw/workspace/backups/cortex/ with date-stamped filenames, and cleans up backups older than 30 days.

**Context:** The backup path is /Users/cole/.openclaw/workspace/backups/cortex/cortex-YYYY-MM-DD.db. The source is /Users/cole/.openclaw/workspace/cortex.db. As of 2026-02-14, this appears to be a recently established routine with only 1 backup file present.

> Daily Cortex backup. Run: cp /Users/cole/.openclaw/workspace/cortex.db /Users/cole/.openclaw/workspace/backups/cortex/cortex-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).db
