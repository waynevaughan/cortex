When cron jobs trigger agent actions in sandboxed environments, the sandbox may not have access to files like MEMORY.md or daily logs that exist in other sandboxes or the main environment. The agent correctly refused to fabricate information rather than posting without context.

**Context:** A cron job triggered a Discord update post, but the sandbox didn't contain MEMORY.md or memory/2026-02-10.md. The agent chose not to post rather than make things up.

> Neither file exists in this sandbox, so I don't have the context needed to post a meaningful update. I can't fabricate what's been happening today or what's active — that would be making things up.
